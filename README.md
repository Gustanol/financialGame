  - access [http://localhost:8080/users](http://localhost:8080/users) to view all users.
  - filter which user will appear by writing its ID after "***/users/***". Example: `/users/2`
  - you can filter also by user name, using a ***Query Parameter***. Example: `/users?name=John`
  - Add new users by using ***POST*** HTTP method at `http://localhost:8080/users/create/{USERNAME}`
  - lend money from a user to another also using POST method. Example: `http://localhost:8080/money/lend?amount=350&fromUser=John&toUser=Anna`
